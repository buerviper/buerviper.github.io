Hello there! I'm Dr. Mathias Micheel, a Physical Chemist from Germany. On this website, you may find more about my research and myself. From time to time, I might even drop random thoughts here - just like it was my personal blog in 2004!

{% quote ciamician_photochemistry_1912 --file photochemistry %}
And if in a distant future the supply of coal becomes completely exhausted, civilization will not be checked by that, for life and civilization will continue as long as the sun shines!
{% endquote %}

More than 100 years ago, Ciamician expressed his vision of a civilization which covers its energy needs not on the basis of fossil fuels, but by direct utilization of solar energy. Instead of smokestacks from coal and oil factories, the chemical industry of the future would use glass tubes to drive their reactions.

As a child from the Ruhr area, with its long history in coal mining and steel refining, I am every much committed to realizing his dream, which remains unfulfilled to date, and try to convert solar energy into so-called *solar fuels*.
